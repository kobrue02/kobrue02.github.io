                    <h1> Who am I? </h1>
                    My name is Konrad, I'm from Potsdam and I'm 20 years old.<br>
                    Currently, I am studying Computational Linguistics at the University of Potsdam 
                    in the fifth semester and am looking to get my Bachelor in 2024. <br>
                    I am mainly interested in NLP, NLG, sentiment analysis and argument mining and have worked on a few projects in those fields. <br>
                    If you want to check out some of my programming projects on Github, you can do so here. <br>
                    You can also find me on LinkedIn. <br>
                    <h1> What else do I do? </h1>
                    Besides being into languages and programming, I've also been playing the drums for 15 years, which I now teach as well. <br>
                    Since 2017, I also practice weighlifting and since 2022 I do Muay Thai. <br>
                    So, if I'm not attending a lecture or working on a coding project, I am most likely practicing the drums or doing sports! <br>

                <h1>Agariopedia </h1>
                Agariopedia is a multiplayer online game encyclopedia that is made accessible through an interactive Discord bot 
                and gets the data from a database I've built with a friend. <br>
                You can find the source code on my Github profile! <br>

                <h1>Stock Market Prediction Tool </h1>
                This project is currently in progress. <br>
                We are attempting to train a model to predict prices in the stock market based on the sentiment analysis of social media. <br>
                There is a bit of research on this topic already, like this paper by Pagolu et al. and this paper by Khedr et al., 
                in which the authors were able to train those prediction models with an accuracy of up to 87%. <br>
                Currently, the tool has an interface for reddit, twitter, stocktwits, news headlines and 4chan 
                and performs sentiment analysis on the data scrapped from those. <br>
                However, we are still working on the model. <br>

                <h1>Gentify </h1>
                Gentify is a spotify playlist generation tool built in Python using the Spotipy library. <br>
                The user gets a list of genres to choose from (up to 5) and the script generates a playlist based off those genres. <br>
                I am still working on this project and looking to improve it and add more features. <br>
                This is a sample playlist created by the tool. <br>

                <h1> Lifts4U </h1>
                Lifts4u is a website that hosts 150+ training programs for advanced weightlifters. <br>
                The user base is fairly small and averages to 1.000/mo, however this was one of my first projects and I am happy some people still use it.
